# Huntix Tool



The Huntix tool is a bash script designed to streamline local privilege escalation during Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like THM and HTB. It addresses the frustration of searching for clues and misconfigurations during privilege escalation attempts. Huntix offers various options to automate the detection of potential vulnerabilities that can aid in escalating user privileges to root. This script simplifies the process, allowing users to quickly scan for threats and vulnerabilities, saving time and effort. While not groundbreaking, Huntix is a good tool for cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to enhance their skills and succeed in CTF challenges.
